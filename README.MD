## 🔧 Setting Up the Environment

To ensure smooth execution of the code, we recommend setting up a dedicated Python environment using Anaconda. Here's how to get started:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo

2. Create the Conda environment from the provided environment.yml file:
   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml

3. Activate the environment:
   ```bash
    conda activate <your-env-name>

## 📚 Available Scripts

### 1️⃣ **`train_transformer_no_files.py`**
Train a new model from scratch without using external datasets.  
This script focuses on generating models based purely on internal computations.

**Run it with:**
```bash
python train_transformer_no_files.py


### 2️⃣ **`Safety_trainer.py`**
Train models using external datasets, specifically matrices shaped `(50, 1000)`.  
Ensure your datasets are pre-processed and properly formatted before running this script.

**Run it with:**
```bash
python Safety_trainer.py

## ✨ Features

- **Reproducibility**: Follow our simple steps to replicate the results from the paper. 🔄
- **Flexibility**: Train models with or without external datasets. 🧠
- **Customizable**: Easily tweak parameters to explore new ideas. ⚙️
