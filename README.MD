## üîß Setting Up the Environment

To ensure smooth execution of the code, we recommend setting up a dedicated Python environment using Anaconda. Here's how to get started:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RedLynx96/Estimation_of_safety_functions.git
   cd Estimation_of_safety_functions
   ```

2. Create the Conda environment from the provided environment.yml file:
   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   ```

3. Activate the environment:
   ```bash
    conda activate SafetyFunctionAI
   ```

## üìö Available Scripts

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **`train_transformer_no_files.py`**
Train a new model from scratch without using external datasets.  
This script focuses on generating models based purely on internal computations.

**Run it with:**
   ```bash
   python train_transformer_no_files.py
   ```


### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **`Safety_trainer.py`**
Train models using external datasets, specifically matrices shaped `(50, 1000)`.  
Ensure your datasets are pre-processed and properly formatted before running this script.
**Ensure that cuDNN is property installed to reduce computation times!**

**Run it with:**
   ```bash
   python Safety_trainer.py
   ```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **`Predictor_GUI.py`**

A standalone GUI application designed for predicting safety functions.

#### **Key Features**
- **Graphical User Interface**: Intuitive and user-friendly for seamless interaction.
- **Real-Time Predictions**: Provides visualizations of safety function predictions interactively.

#### **System Requirements**
To ensure the application runs smoothly, ensure the following:
- A **graphics card** with appropriate drivers and CUDA support is installed.

**Run it with:**
   ```bash
   python Predictor_GUI.py
   ```
> **Note**: This application is designed for **local use** due to its graphical nature and reliance on GPU resources. Ensure your system meets the hardware requirements (including a compatible graphics card) before running the GUI.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **`predictor_colab.ipynb`**
Run the predictor in Google Colab, bypassing the need for a local graphics card.

**To use:**

1. **Open the notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/RedLynx96/Estimation_of_safety_functions/blob/main/Predictor_Colab.ipynb).**

2. **Enable a GPU or TPU in the Colab runtime settings:**
   - Go to `Runtime` > `Change runtime type`.
   - Select `GPU` or `TPU` from the Hardware accelerator dropdown.

3. **Execute the notebook cells** to run the predictor seamlessly on Google's infrastructure.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Lorenz_Classical_Safety_Estimator_Matlab.m**

This MATLAB script is **mandatory** for computing the classical safety function of the Lorenz system, as it accounts for variable noise in data. The computed safety function is crucial for comparisons with the transformer-based model.

#### **Key Features**
- **Generates Sampled Data (`xVectors`)**: Creates a dataset of sampled orbits from the Lorenz system under partial control.
- **Computes Classical Safety Function (`Us`)**: Estimates the classical safety function with noise-adaptive modeling.
- **Visualizes the Lorenz Attractor**: Provides 3D trajectory plots and Poincar√© section analysis.
- **Supports Controlled Trajectory Computation**: Enables testing of controlled orbits using classical or machine-learning-based safety functions.

#### **Usage Instructions**
1. **Run the script in MATLAB**:
   ```matlab
   Lorenz_Classical_Safety_Estimator_Matlab
